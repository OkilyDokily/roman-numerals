| find largest numeral that is higher than value and the numeral value on less then that value and preappend the lower value  | 49    | XL    |
| determine if 5 or 6 is higher if 6 is not over value otherwise default to 5                                                 | 49    | 6     |
| subtract determination made at step 7 from initial value if value is zero return 6                                          | 49    | 9     |
| repeat stages 5 through 7 for remaining value from step 8                                                                   | 9     | IX    |
